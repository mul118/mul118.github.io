Welcome all - this is a blog focused on technology, science, and leadership within the technical field.

First order of business is to give wider exposure to projects that I've been working on for the last few years - a complete environment for interactive EDA, a real-time version of the popular Airflow scheduling platform, etc. Look forward to posts on these coming in the next few days.
