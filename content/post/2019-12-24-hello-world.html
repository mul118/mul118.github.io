<p>Welcome all - this is a blog focused on technology, science, and leadership within the technical field.</p>
<p>First order of business is to give wider exposure to projects that Iâ€™ve been working on for the last few years - a complete environment for interactive EDA, a real-time version of the popular Airflow scheduling platform, etc. Look forward to posts on these coming in the next few days.</p>
